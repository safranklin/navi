# Learning Goals

## Primary Objective
Build Navi — a model-agnostic AI assistant TUI — while learning Rust through practical application.

## Approach
- Reference "The Rust Programming Language" book as concepts arise
- Implement features hands-on, guided by targeted reading
- Document concepts as they're encountered in real code

## Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundations
- [ ] Basic REPL loop (input/output, control flow)
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Project structure and modules

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Configuration management (local personality/context)
- [ ] HTTP client for AI provider APIs
- [ ] Response streaming

### Phase 3: TUI
- [ ] Terminal UI framework integration
- [ ] Chat interface
- [ ] History and scrollback
