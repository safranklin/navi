# Learning Goals

## Primary Objective
Build Navi — a model-agnostic AI assistant TUI — while learning Rust through practical application.

## Approach
- Reference "The Rust Programming Language" book as concepts arise
- Implement features hands-on, guided by targeted reading
- Document concepts as they're encountered in real code

## Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundations
- [x] Basic REPL loop (input/output, control flow)
- [x] Error handling patterns
- [x] Project structure and modules

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Configuration management (local personality/context) - *In Progress (Context struct)*
- [x] HTTP client for AI provider APIs
- [x] Response streaming

### Phase 3: TUI
- [x] Terminal UI framework integration
- [x] Chat interface
- [x] History and scrollback
